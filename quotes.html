		<h1>Ali's Quotes</h1>
		<br>
		
	<p>"The man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life."</p>
			
	<p>"It isn’t the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it’s the pebble in your shoe."</p>
			
	<p>"I’m gonna float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. The hands can’t hit what the eyes can’t see."</p>
			
	<p>"I am an ordinary man who worked hard to develop the talent I was given."</p>
			
	<p>"It’s just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up."</p>
			
	<p>"I set out on a journey of love, seeking truth, peace, and understanding. l am still learning."</p>
			
	<p>"Truly great people in history never wanted to be great for themselves."</p>
			
	<p>"At night when I go to bed, I ask myself, “If I don’t wake up tomorrow, would I be proud of how I lived today?"</p>
