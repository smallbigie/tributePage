	<p>Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 â€“ June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer and activist. Nicknamed "the Greatest", he is regarded as one of the most significant sports figures of the 20th century and is often regarded as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. Ali became an Olympic gold medalist in 1960 and the world heavyweight boxing champion in 1964. Following his suspension for refusing military service in the Vietnam War, Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and devoted much of his time after to philanthropy.
